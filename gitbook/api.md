# API
If you want to use ```oidc-agent``` to easily obtain an access token in your
application you can choose between 
- [liboidc-agent3](api-c.md#liboidc-agent3): Library for the C programming language,
- [liboidcagent-go](api-go.md#liboidcagent-go): Library for the Go programming language,
- [IPC-API](api-ipc.md#ipc-api): Communicate directly with ```oidc-agent```.

When you have integrated your application with `oidc-agent` you can contact us
at [oidc-agent-contact@lists.kit.edu](mailto:oidc-agent-contact@lists.kit.edu) and we will add your application to the [list
of agent clients](oidc-token.md#other-agent-clients).
